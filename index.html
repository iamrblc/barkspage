        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>The following text was generated by copilot from scratch. WTF. Our lab is focused on developing and applying computational methods to study the brain and behavior. We are particularly interested in understanding how the brain processes information and makes decisions in complex environments. Our research is highly interdisciplinary and combines techniques from computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and engineering. We are always looking for motivated students and collaborators to join our team. Please contact us if you are interested in learning more about our work.</p>

        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Our lab is led by Dr. John Doe, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of X. Dr. Doe received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Y and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Z. He is passionate about using computational methods to understand the brain and behavior. Dr. Doe is always looking for talented students and postdocs to join his lab. Please contact him if you are interested in learning more about his work.</p>
